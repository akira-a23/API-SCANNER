# Potential API Key Checker

This is a simple Python tool that helps you check your code files for things that might look like API keys. It looks for long strings of letters and numbers, which are common in API keys.

**Important:** This tool is designed to help you *find potential* keys in your own files *before* you share them. It does not search the internet or other people's code.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the script:** Save the Python code (the one we created earlier, `key_checker.py`) to your computer.
2.  **Open your command line (or terminal):**
    * **Windows:** Search for "cmd" in the Start Menu.
    * **macOS:** Open the "Terminal" application (in Applications > Utilities).
3.  **Go to the folder:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you saved `key_checker.py`. For example, if it's in your "Downloads" folder, type `cd Downloads` and press Enter.
4.  **Run the script:** Type `python key_checker.py` and press Enter.
5.  **Enter the file path:** The tool will ask you to type the location (path) of the file you want to check. For example, if you want to check a file called `my_project.py` in the same folder, just type `my_project.py` and press Enter. If it's somewhere else, you'll need to type the full path (like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\my_project\my_project.py` on Windows or `/Users/YourName/Documents/my_project/my_project.py` on macOS).

## What it Does

The script will read through the file you choose and look for lines that contain long sequences of letters and numbers. If it finds any, it will show you the line number and the line itself.

## What to Remember

* **It might not be perfect:** This tool looks for patterns and might sometimes highlight things that aren't actually API keys.
* **You need to double-check:** Always look at the lines the tool shows you and decide if they really contain a private key that you shouldn't share.
* **It only checks the file you tell it to:** It doesn't search your whole computer or the internet.

This README provides a basic explanation of what your script does and how to use it. As you make your tool more advanced (like adding a UI or the ability to check links), you'll want to update this README with more information!
